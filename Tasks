Milestone 2:
Scrum master: Collin

Week 1 of sprint:

Create Github repo, share with instructor, familiarize with version control over the week, by wednesday.

Tackle the first two requirements of the project by Saturday May 31st.
Design Document (20 pts) -- document that describes the high-level functionality of your application.  Your document will need at least 2 User Stories and 10-15 use cases outlining the functionality of your application.  (Ranges here are deliberate to avoid making your use cases too broad or too narrow.)
4 use cases per team member, finished by latest Thursday, Meeting Thursday @ 9pm


Working Prototype  (40 pts) -- prototype of your application that works from the command line -- it should ask for an input file and then process that file (using the console for any input/output specified by the file contents itself).  This is a prototype, so code it with an eye towards getting it working first, but also with an eye towards (as yet unknown) future expansion.  ALL team members must contribute to the code base -- you will need to submit a link to your source control base (or a screenshot from your source control that shows that all team members have checked in code for your project).
