Today, we met for the first time and discussed the project launch details.  The details are in a separate “Project Launch Details” document.  We decided on a scrum master schedule, a regular meeting time for our meetings, and we talked a little bit about our education/coding background.  We decided on Github for source control, and we will use a shared Google document to record meeting notes and keep a list of tasks that need to be completed for each milestone/sprint.

Milestone 2

Discussed our proposed schedule for milestone scrum. Will have another meeting Thursday @ 9pm to follow up with project requirements. Each team member will be working on 4 use cases for the design document, which we will complete by Thursday 5/29 or earlier. Each team member will also watch the week 4 video, as well as familiarize with github and version control practices so that our main is updated smoothly. On Thursday, we will meet together to go over the prototype requirements and starter code, where responsibilities will be divided between team members.
